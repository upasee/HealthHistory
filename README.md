# HealthHistory

This app improves the doctor-patient interactions at the Stony Brook University Hospital by
monitoring the complete family health history and fitness records of the patient.
It allows the patient to store their allergies, daily medications, surgeries, medical conditions, 
emergency contacts, insurance plans, calories, weight, etc. and allows the doctor to generate reports
based on the above data
